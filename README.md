# RobuHub
RobuHub is an iOS Application to list all public repositories from Github and it's Robusta's task for iOS Software Engineer hiring process ðŸ”¥

## High level overview

#### Domain 

The `Domain` is basically what is RobuHub's App about and what it can do (Entities, UseCase etc.) **It does not depend on UIKit or any persistence framework**, and it doesn't have implementations apart from entities.

#### Platform

The `Platform` is a concrete implementation of the `Domain` in a specific platform like iOS. It does hide all implementation details. For example Database implementation whether it is CoreData, Realm, SQLite or Netowkring and Calling APIs using URLSession, Alamofire etc.

#### Application
`Application` is responsible for delivering information to the user and handling user input. It can be implemented with any delivery pattern e.g (MVVM, MVC, MVP). This is the place for your `UIView`s and `UIViewController`s. As you will see from the app, `ViewControllers` are completely independent of the `Platform`.  The only responsibility of a view controller is to "bind" the UI to the Domain to make things happen.
